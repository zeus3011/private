<span className="text-bold text-2xl">Does missing credit card bills lead to loan rejection?</span> <br/><br/>
<span className=" text-base">Missing credit card bills will not lead to loan rejection. The lender is looking for the history of payment habits and whether potential customers have the ability to consistently make their payments on time. Most lenders do accept partial payments on credit cards but if you miss three consecutive payments then you will be considered delinquent. If you continue with this behavior, your application for a loan or other type of financing may be declined or put on hold indefinitely until the problem has been resolved

By making timely payments, keeping your balance low, and avoiding maxing out your credit limit, you can demonstrate your financial responsibility to credit bureaus. This can lead to a better credit score, which in turn can improve your chances of being approved for loans, credit cards, and other financial products. So, next time you use your credit card, keep in mind that you're not only making a purchase, but also building a positive credit history.

Unfortunately, this can have negative consequences on your credit score and financial health. Your lender may charge a late fee or penalty, and your credit score may be impacted. Moreover, missing multiple payments can lead to loan default, which can result in legal action, loss of collateral, or even bankruptcy. If you're struggling to make your EMI payments, it's important to contact your lender and discuss your options, such as restructuring your loan or extending the repayment period. Ignoring the problem will only make it worse. So, stay proactive and take steps to avoid missing EMI payments.

Simply contact your lender and request the change. Depending on the lender's policy, you may be able to switch from one mode of repayment to another, such as from EMI to ECS or vice versa. Be prepared to provide your loan account number, new mode of repayment details, and any other necessary information. Once the change is made, be sure to monitor your loan account and ensure that payments are being deducted as per the new mode. Remember, timely payments are crucial for maintaining a good credit score and avoiding penalties. So, don't hesitate to make the change if it helps you manage your loan better.
